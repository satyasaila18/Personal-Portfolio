# Personal-Portfolio 
A portfolio can be physical (a binder) or digital (an e-portfolio), and its contents vary, but generally include:

Artifacts (The Work): These are the pieces of work that demonstrate learning and skill.

Exemplary projects, essays, research papers, lab reports.

Artwork, design mockups, code samples, or videos.

Photos or documentation of non-academic achievements (e.g., community service, club leadership, competition entries).

Reflections: This is the most crucial part, where the student provides context and self-analysis.

A description of the artifact and the skills/knowledge it required.

An explanation of why the piece was chosen for the portfolio.

A reflection on what was learned from the experience, how challenges were overcome, or how they would approach a similar task differently in the future.
